# Introduction

## ðŸš§ Work in progress ðŸš§

This book is largely incomplete. If you want to contribute, feel free to [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/3xZJ65GAhd) and start a discussion there.

While the book is being worked on, the best resources to get started with iced are:

- The [API Reference](https://docs.iced.rs/iced/)
- The [official examples](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/tree/master/examples)
- The codebase of [many open-source iced projects](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/issues/355)

[iced] is a cross-platform GUI library for [Rust]. It is inspired by [Elm], a delightful functional language for building web applications.

As a GUI library, iced helps you build _[graphical user interfaces]_ for your Rust applications.

iced is strongly focused on **simplicity** and **type-safety**. As a result, iced tries to provide simple building blocks than can be put together with strong typing to reduce the chance of **runtime errors**.

This book will:

- Introduce you to the fundamental ideas of iced.
- Teach you how to build interactive applications with iced.
- Emphasize principles to scale and grow iced applications.

Before proceeding, you should have some basic familiarity with Rust. If you are new to Rust or feel lost at some point, I recommend you to read [the official Rust book].
